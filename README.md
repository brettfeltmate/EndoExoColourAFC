# EndoExoColourAFC

Colour discrimination task employing endogenous & exogenous alerting signals.

A modification of: https://github.com/brettfeltmate/EndoExoColourDiscrim

Stimulus events, both in sequence & timing are replicated from the original where possible. The key distinguishing feature here is that the requirement to make a detection response has been dropped.
